# Tutorial - JavaScript

Purpose: 
Working through JavaScript: The Definitive Guide (6th Ed.), following the examples.

Note: I am trying to "boil down" the book's examples into one or two sets that concisely represent the concept taught. This means most examples do not appear exactly as they are in the book, but in the way that they are most memorable and meaningful to me. Further, many examples may not exist at all in the book; these are me  testing through fringe cases or other ideas that occur to me as I read/code.

Also, these files will be heavily commented to act as an instructional reference (mostly for myself).
